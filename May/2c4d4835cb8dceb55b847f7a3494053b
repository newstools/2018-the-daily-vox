The memorial service of the late Wits Engineering student, Sanele Dhlamini,  will be held by the university. Dhlamini passed away after falling  from a residence in Braamfontein last week Thursday. During my 2nd year of varsity I stayed in Clifton Heights and I was depressed AF. The setup of that building is very depressing, it gets worse when @WitsUniversity exerts a lot of pressure on students. #BraamSuicide — Nqobile Gaga (@Glam_GagaXO) May 12, 2018 The memorial will take place on Wednesday, May 16, at Lecture Theatre 101 in the FNB Building  situated at the university’s West Campus in Braamfontein. The service will commence at 13:00. According to Buhle Zuma, the university’s senior communications officer, the university is still offering therapy and counselling sessions for Dhlamini’s friends and is supporting the family during this period of loss.
