Not one for reality TV, I never watch shows like Date My Family. But the buzz on my TL and comparisons to Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela had me wondering what the hell went on in last night’s episode. Searching the show’s hashtag had me hooked, scrolling through hundreds of tweets about the bachelor and his trashy behaviour. Moremogolo’s verbose manner of speaking had audiences and family members confused. Watching Moremogolo was like watching someone who used a thesaurus once try to convince us he was a linguist. The way he spoke even garnered him the title of Steve Komphela’s son. Komphela is notorious for giving verbose and nonsensical interviews after matches. Moremogolo is something else. RT to make someone else’s day. #DateMyFamily pic.twitter.com/KfEDqcjIFq — Good Vibes  (@Passeks) April 8, 2018  #DateMyFamily he went from pots to komphela to 5 skippers in one episode pic.twitter.com/bLKfagD8Oc — Ntsakisi (@Ndhambi_nation) April 8, 2018  From his indifferent attempt at explaining that he could possibly cheat on his girlfriend, to spraying the whipped cream meant for the table directly into his mouth, Moremogolo’s behaviour was so bad it had the Limpopo part of black Twitter disavowing him. #DateMyFamily Main Chick is now called Headquarters and Side Pieces Decentralised Branches. pic.twitter.com/V6mGsj82qO — B_E_R_R_Y  (@BernadineShekup) April 8, 2018  This honestly has to be the BEST moment from this #DateMyFamily  pic.twitter.com/O9m9WphpPe — JUNIOR DE ROCKA (@JuniorDeRocka) April 8, 2018  We as Limpopians, we don’t know this guy#DateMyFamily pic.twitter.com/6MzQPxxrVV — Mr T (@Sir_Timu) April 8, 2018  Moremogolo even did one of his date’s friend dirty. The man was going in for a congratulatory handshake and Moremogolo passes him his jacket so that he could pick her up. Lol hahaha the poor guy was going for a handshake and ended up being the jacket hanger Look closely  #DateMyFamily #DMF pic.twitter.com/iJHYXwg9PG — Ntsako Shibambo (@Ntsanessa) April 8, 2018  A quick look at his Instagram and Moremogolo Exton describes himself as a stage and screen actor. Was he just playing it up for the camera’s or is he really this far gone?  As an alleged campus mate pointed out, she can’t wait to bump into him and laugh at his behaviour all for fame. #DateMyFamily  Our fellow Mate just decided to make a fool of himself…can’t wait to bump into him on campus(UL) and laugh at him..all for what ??, FAME ? pic.twitter.com/kmOFAZncSx — Prokureur Leshabela  (@LadyMo_Lesh) April 8, 2018  Featured image via Facebook
