Join The Daily Vox journalists SHAAZIA EBRAHIM and FATIMA MOOSA every week as they chat all things fun and serious around fan culture, fandoms and what it means to be a stan. They’ll be destroying tropes around the supposedly traditional hardcore male football fan and the manic pop culture fangirl; covering everything from football, Young Adult fiction to Beyoncé and K-pop. Living in the fanworld as women of colour who are avid consumers of all things fan-related means that it is impossible to ignore the politics of these things. And that’s what the Critical Stans are all about. It’s the special edition of The Critical Stans. In this episode we lament all the podcasts we could have made, but didn’t because pop culture news never takes a rest. We talk Comic Con Africa and what we learned about cosplay, consent and representation. We speak of all the badass female characters that JK Rowling wrote in Harry Potter from Hermione Granger to Dolores Umbridge. The final two topics we wanted to cover was K-dramas and the romance novel genre. We chat about our favourite K-dramas and why we think romance gets such a bad reputation in literary circles.
