There’s no doubt that Michael Jackson was the greatest artist of our time. Artists will forever imitate his incredible style, musical genius and dancing prowess. On 29 August, the King of Pop would have been 60. The star died almost a decade ago on 25 June 2009 at the age of 50. In tribute, SHAAZIA EBRAHIM and FATIMA MOOSA put together their favourite Michael Jackson songs. Happy Birthday, Michael! On this day of the Diamond Celebration we hope all fans around the world will join in celebrating the immortal Michael Jackson and his legacy of astounding artistic achievement and his philanthropic and humanitarianism efforts wherever he went. pic.twitter.com/IRTsipxAY0 — Michael Jackson (@michaeljackson) August 29, 2018  Beat me, hate me
 You can never break me
 Will me, thrill me
 You can never kill me
 Jew me, sue me
 Everybody do me
 Kick me, kike me
 Don’t you black or white me All I wanna say is that
 They don’t really care about us  ‘Cause this is thriller, thriller night
 There ain’t no second chance against the thing with the forty eyes, girl
 Thriller, thriller night
 You’re fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight  That you are not alone
 I am here with you
 Though you’re far away
 I am here to stay  Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
 No one wants to be defeated
 Showin’ how funky and strong is your fight
 It doesn’t matter who’s wrong or right  You Rock My World You rocked my world, you know you did
 And everything I own I give
 The rarest love who’d think I’d find
 Someone like you to call mine  Billie Jean People always told me be careful of what you do
 And don’t go around breaking young girls’ hearts  I’ve been a victim of a selfish kind of love
 It’s time that I realise
 That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
 Could it be really me, pretending that they’re not alone?  So they came into the outway
 It was Sunday – what a black day
 Mouth to mouth
 Resuscitation
 Sounding heartbeats – intimidation  Don’t tell me you agree with me
 When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
 But, if you’re thinkin’ about my baby
 It don’t matter if you’re black or white  Liberian girl
 You know that you came
 And you changed my world
 Just like in the movies
