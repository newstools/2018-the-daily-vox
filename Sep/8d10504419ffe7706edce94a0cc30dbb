“A is for Awesome like this podcast” is a weekly podcast from comedian YAASEEN BARNES and writer KAREN JEYNES, where they share interesting facts and stories, and inject a little positivity and entertainment into your day. If you want to know which world record Zimbabwe recently claimed, why babies only blink twice a minute, or why frogs say “ribbit”, this is a podcast for you. Join them on their quest to discover the awesome which is all around us. We’re back! And we’re talking about those remarkable occasions when advertisers actually get it right. By which we really mean, those remarkable occasions when adverts make bigots super angry, and the rest of us get to laugh at them. Now that’s truly awesome.  Catchy jingle by Godfrey Johnson. New doses available every Wednesday. Find A is for Awesome on iTunes. Follow us on Twitter: @ya_a_seen_him and @karenjeynes.
