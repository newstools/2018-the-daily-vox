The 2018 South African Book Fair ran from 7 to 9 September at Johannesburg’s Newtown Cultural Precinct. It was a wonderful affair complete with book exhibition stands, poetry, theatre and engaging panel discussions on a range of topics. This year’s theme was Our Stories and it celebrated South African identity in it’s multiplicity. SHAAZIA EBRAHIM and FATIMA MOOSA were there.
