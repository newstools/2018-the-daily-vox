President Cyril Ramaphosa announced his first cabinet reshuffle on Monday night – announcing sweeping changes to the team he’d inherited from his deposed predecessor Jacob Zuma. (Who, incidentally, made 11 changes to his cabinet during his tenure, including two in 2017.) The Daily Vox gives you the breakdown of which ministers are out, which are new, and which have been shown the door. (This list is based on Zuma’s last cabinet, so some “new” ministers are in fact returning from earlier reshuffles.) The new cabinet was not without its surprises, with controversial ministers like Bathabile Dlamini, Malusi Gigaba and Nomvula Mokonyane somehow surviving the reshuffle, even as others like Mosebenzi Zwane and Des van Rooyen not making the cut. Ramaphosa’s ANC conference rival Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma made it in, as did Pravin Gordhan and Nhlanhla Nene, both of whom were unceremoniously sacked by Zuma as finance ministers.
