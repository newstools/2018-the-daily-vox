Valentine’s Day 2018 left South Africa shook, and not because someone sent us roses unexpectedly. Not since the Zimbabwean coup-lite last year has this country been under as much stress as this week. The one and only President Jacob Zuma – the laughing one, survivor of the no-confidence vote, shunner of the rape accusations, first of his name – went on live television and actually resigned. Sjoe. Some of us refuse to believe it. I can’t believe it! Actually, I’m still waiting for Leon Schuster to pop out on the screen any moment now to say “Dis ‘n grappie julle… You’ve been Schucksed!”#ZumaResigns — KubenK (@KubenKDJ) February 14, 2018  Announced so late at night that most of us probably haven’t received the news yet, the resignation sent South African twitter into hysteria. #ZumaResigns
It is very risky to sleep in this country! You will wake up to a new cabinet or a new president — MollyK (@thatzimlady) February 14, 2018  On Valentine’s Day even? Some of us can’t tell if we got dumped or received the best gift ever! @Stuart_Phillips this is how to be romantic in politics #zumaresigns pic.twitter.com/0rXuHac6kP — Tegan Phillips (@Unclippd) February 14, 2018  I mean, what’s a box of chocolates compared to the rand at R11,67 to the dollar? Right? Rand speaks for itself after uBaba decided to dump us as a nation on a Valentine’s day. #ZumaExit pic.twitter.com/2utDhYBL7E — IG: mvunyelwaradebe (@MvunyelwaRadebe) February 14, 2018  It isn’t really a victory, but sometimes you just need to celebrate anyway. From a butternut to a cupcake. Weigh that shit up. Count calories. — Kwanele Sosibo (@KwaneleSosibo) February 14, 2018  But maybe it is a little bittersweet. After all, this has been a long, long relationship. It’s hard to let go sometimes. Farewell comrade, farewell… #ZumaExit#ZumaResigns pic.twitter.com/SJEtLaVNI6 — Misozi_Gondwe (@_Misozi) February 14, 2018  Either way, whether you’re head-over-heels or heartbroken, no one can say South Africa isn’t an exciting place to live! Now to prepare ourselves for the next scene… Now, this place here called Sassafrika is the best live movie ever… Farewell Mr Zuma; your presidency was one for the books. #ZumaResigns pic.twitter.com/WykJD7Pf2d — T.H Maloa (@frozenthoughtz) February 14, 2018
