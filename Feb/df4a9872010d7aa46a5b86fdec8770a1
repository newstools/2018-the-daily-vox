Happy Valentines Day South Africa! South Africans woke up to news on Wednesday that the Hawks had raided the Gupta compound which houses infamous Gupta family, business friends of South African President Jacob Zuma. Folk on Twitter had all the questions. The Hawks confirmed on Wednesday morning that a raid was underway at the Saxonwold residence of the controversial Gupta family.

South Africans were still reeling from the news that the African National Congress (ANC) recalled uBaba on Tuesday. We are waiting for him to respond, it’s Valentine’s Day and on top of that a Gupta raid? It’s too much, too early. Gupta’s day/ Valentines day/ #ZumaRecall ?
Which one is it? pic.twitter.com/rSaTlJVaHh — ONATELLY  (@Sharx515) February 14, 2018  Happy #ValentinesDay to the #Gupta family from the #Hawks.  pic.twitter.com/bfA9mv6S6u — Derick Watts & T.S.B (@derickwatts) February 14, 2018  It’s high drama with Saxonwold drive closed off because of the commotion. #Saxonwold drive closed around the #Gupta compound … reports of a #Hawks raid. Can’t make this stuff up  pic.twitter.com/62P6391COC — Dinesh Balliah (@DineshBalliah) February 14, 2018  Not only are the Hawks raiding properties, there are reports that they’ve arrested people too. So far, three people have been arrested including a Gupta brother and a business associate. Two more people are expected to hand themselves over. The #SABCNews reports on the raids & arrests from #Gupta compound. @Chriseldalewis confirms that #Hawks say more arrests expected. pic.twitter.com/Q5c9ZRv2DV — Thabiso Sithole (@ThabisoSithole) February 14, 2018  According to EWN the Hawks are closing in on other areas in the province to arrest more people linked to the Free State dairy farm project which has been found by no less than the Public Protector to have been a looting scheme. The Gupta compound is just one part of the mission. The #Hawks say the raid at the #Gupta home in Saxonwold is part of a bigger operation. #SabcNews — rhulani baloyi (@rhulani1baloyi) February 14, 2018  It’s all good and well that the Hawk’s have regained their claws again but the timing of the raids and arrests have folk suspicious. It’s only been one day since Zuma’s recall – though on Wednesday morning, as the raids went down, he had yet to formally resign. A raid on the morning after u Baba’ is told to resign?? #Hawks #saxonworld pic.twitter.com/bGLFpmdPDE — Ngawo La Mazangwe (@ngawoz) February 14, 2018  This kind of action was expected a long time ago – when it was first proved that the Guptas had unsavoury links to members of the ANC government. #Hawks are raiding/visiting the #Guptas months after #GuptaLeaks spilled into the news, and years after the Guptas became a thing.
Also about 36 hours after the #ANC fired #Zuma. — Pauli Van Wyk (@PaulivW) February 14, 2018  Will all this convince all those ANC MPs who might want to the defy party line and vote for Zuma in a motion of no confidence? There’s nothing quite like an early morning #Hawks raid on the #Gupta compound to remind people how to vote in a motion of no confidence — Jack Devnarain (@JackD157) February 14, 2018  Most importantly, why was Mbaks so quiet on Twitter? The Minister of Police usually advertises the successful arrests of criminals. @MbalulaFikile your are seriously going to ignore the happenings in #Saxonworld nd you are not going to tweet as usual about the successful arrest of criminals, the #Guptas, or complement the #Hawks on a job well done on #ValetinesDay you are just like #Gigaba and #Zuma — Muzi (@muziDv) February 14, 2018  Some said we should not be elated at all by the news that an operation to root out Gupta-linked corruption is underway. This only goes to show that the Hawks have been politically compromised. For me the arrest of the Gupta brothers by the Hawks doesn’t excite me or cause any cause for relief.
It instead further drives the point that the Hawks are compromised and are subject to political influence. #Zexit — Bandile Mathandela (@BMathandela) February 14, 2018  We should all be worried that (as it appears) only after Nasrec have the #Hawks found their claws again. Law enforcement MUST NEVER be politicized. Question: Where have they been & why have they not acted over this past decade of lies, theft & corruption.
Don’t be fooled. #Guptas — Vusi Thembekwayo (@VusiThembekwayo) February 14, 2018
