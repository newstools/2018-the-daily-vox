The recent Date My Family episode has set a high bar, following an awesome bachelorette featured, 29-year-old Rey from Johannesburg. Meanwhile the bachelors and their families went as far as saying Ray was not what they had expected. Black Twitter was left in stitches with her bubbly personality and wisdom. Many viewers have previously expressed disappointment and dissatisfaction over Mzansi Magic’s staged dating show, claiming that it has lost its touch and is no longer entertaining. This was until this Sunday evening’s episode which featured Rey, who turned things around with what most viewers found to be a charismatic character. In the previous shows, most women would ask questions that tweeps consider to be irrelevant for a dating show. Some would go as far as asking what men do for a living and if they have cars. People who know their story don’t ask the “what do you do for a living question”. Wow Rey made my heart warm inside, not even once did she ask if the guys had cars, etc#DateMyFamily — Ms_Gupta (@African_Spring) March 11, 2018  However, Rey won people’s hearts with the awesome presentation of herself. Most tweeps were impressed with her wise nature and intellectual maturity. Meanwhile some people found this episode to be the most believable and an amazing one, and commended it for being educative on self love and presentation. Ray is beautiful, wise and has an amazing personality!  #DateMyFamily — Boity Thulo (@Boity) March 11, 2018  Today’s episode enlightened us of the impact of a good personality #DateMyFamily pic.twitter.com/0A8faQy5xj — #T’challa (@Surebar_47) March 11, 2018  Date My family has been popular for its highlights and moments from different episodes and people have shared general jokes around it. But with this recent episode, some people went as far as judging Rey on her body weight and derogatory memes started making rounds on Twitter. This behaviour has been condemned by people who deemed it to be body shaming and distasteful. Rey might have projected her confidence properly on the show but some people still found a way to bash her for her plus-sized body. #DateMyFamily If she can do this to bench, Imagine the bed pic.twitter.com/kkFJCVHZ38 — APEX (@APEXworld_) March 11, 2018  Why do people treat big women like they have some sort of disease? #DateMyFamily pic.twitter.com/lCbGyeae6D — Ms. Aphane (@ntubby011) March 11, 2018  Although the bachelors were reluctant at first because they had different expectations of who Rey was, the date at the end of the show was a successful one.

Sometimes you need to look past your *type* and open your mind to other possibilities. — Sukoluhle Nyathi (@SueNyathi) March 11, 2018  Among people who were amused by the hurtful and distasteful slurs made about rey’s body were women, but some were quick enough to call it out. I pray that one day we will stop body shaming each other as women #DateMyFamily — Sebe Nyambose (@NyamboseSebe) March 11, 2018
