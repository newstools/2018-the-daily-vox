Hold on to your wigs, Drake just dropped his double album Scorpion and Twitter is about to break. The 25-track album has all the pre-released certified bops like God’s Plan, Nice for What and I’m Upset. It features all of our favs including Nicki Minaj, Future, Ty Dolla $ign, Static Major and Jay Z. Perhaps the biggest shocker is that the album features an unreleased track from the late King of Pop Michael Jackson. Scorpion was only released in the early hours of Friday and has been trending on Twitter since Thursday. The Daily Vox rounds up the Twitter reactions.   Remember everyone’s favourite Drake album Take Care? It was a Tumblr aesthetic and a lifestyle. Yeah, some are saying Scorpion is even better.  Scorpion also brings back R&B Drake whom we all know and love.  Our fav is not just giving us music – he is giving us poetry!  One of the biggest shockers for those listening was Drake’s confirmation that he does indeed have a son.  On his song Emotionless, Drake addresses his beef with Pusha-T’ who accused Drake of fathering and hiding a son in Story of Adidon.  Then, in his song March 14 Drake speaks about being a father.  Of course folk were shaken that Drake resurrected the legend Michael Jackson on his album. Drake literally woke Michael Jackson from the dead to do a feature with him… the fucking audacity — Andy (@AndyJoseph66) June 29, 2018  Be warned: Instagram is about to be packed with Drake lyrics featured as captions. Not gon lie to y’all I don’t usually do this but this drake got me bout to start dropping insta captions on y’all for the whole month of July — Donovan Mitchell (@spidadmitchell) June 29, 2018  But, apparently Drake is also giving folk inspiration to enter the DMs. Wait someone said A Side for Captions and B Side for DMs  #drake #scorpion pic.twitter.com/tjEVo8HO0f — RAP (@Rappertalks) June 29, 2018  It’s not just Instagram, there’s a slew of tweets about Drake lyrics – and we know this is only the beginning. When Drake said “It’s not the cheating that hurts, it’s the type of niggas she cheats with. Now I have to look him in her eyes and see he’s had half of me, and he isn’t even half of me” I felt that — 𝒌𝒂𝒚.

Do not Drake and Drive tonight you may end up at your exes house — Hector Ramirez (@HectoBeTweetin) June 29, 2018  Maybe it isn’t an idea to call your ex. if you my ex don’t let Drake get you cussed the fuck out don’t text me bitch I don’t wanna work shit out — Nel (@1BigNel) June 29, 2018  Seriously, just put the phone down.
