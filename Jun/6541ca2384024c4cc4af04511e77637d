A is for Awesome like this podcast” is a weekly podcast from comedian YAASEEN BARNES and writer KAREN JEYNES, where they share interesting facts and stories, and inject a little positivity and entertainment into your day. If you want to know which world record Zimbabwe recently claimed, why babies only blink twice a minute, or why frogs say “ribbit”, this is a podcast for you. Join them on their quest to discover the awesome which is all around us. It’s time to bust some Hollywood myths, as we tackle the vitally important issue of animal sounds. You’ll get to hear Yaaseen’s best goose impression, we revisit the birds and the bees conversation, and contemplate whether or not David Attenborough is responsible for the sound of a dying walrus.  Catchy jingle by Godfrey Johnson. New doses available every Wednesday. Follow us on Twitter: @ya_a_seen_him and @karenjeynes.
