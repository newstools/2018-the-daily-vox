Egyptians love sweet foods during Ramadan from basboosa which is a semolina cake, konafa which is a cheese pastry filled with nuts or cream, and qatayif – a deep-fried pancake-like dough stuffed with nuts. The most important main dishes on the table are a bean dish seasoned with olive oil and garnished with tomatoes and onions, and soup of any kind. Dried fruit is another favourite during Ramadan. Egyptians also drink Amar El-Din which is made of dried apricot and olive oil and other drinks made of carob, tamarind, and licorice.
