Countdown to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, to be hosted in Russia, has begun with many soccer fanatics placing their bets on different teams. The World Cup will take place from 14 June to 15 July. Among the African teams that have qualified are Nigeria, Senegal, Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia. The Daily Vox spoke to Durbanites to find out which African teams they will be supporting. Ntsikelelo Ndlovu, 19, student, Pinetown I won’t be supporting any African teams because I don’t have much confidence in them. Nokulunga Khalishwayo, 22, student, uMlazi Unfortunately I won’t be supporting any African teams but I will be supporting Brazil, Spain and Argentina. Luyanda Zindela, student, Glenwood I will be supporting Nigeria and Egypt. But the team I have most hopes for in terms of getting the furthest in the world cup is Nigeria. Kevin Mthethwa, 22, student, Ridgeview I’ll be supporting Egypt and Ivory Coast. Egypt because there’s Mohamed Salah. Kwazi Mlanduli, 26, student, uMlazi The team I’ll be supporting is Senegal because of [Sadio] Mané. I believe that he is a good striker and the World Cup is a good opportunity for him to make a name for himself.
