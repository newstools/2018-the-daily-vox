“A is for Awesome like this podcast” is a weekly podcast from comedian YAASEEN BARNES and writer KAREN JEYNES, where they share interesting facts and stories, and inject a little positivity and entertainment into your day. If you want to know which world record Zimbabwe recently claimed, why babies only blink twice a minute, or why frogs say “ribbit”, this is a podcast for you. Join them on their quest to discover the awesome which is all around us. Online shopping can be a bit like gambling, because you might win the thing that you ordered, or you might get something else, or indeed nothing at all. We discuss the future of the post office, why you should go shoe shopping in the afternoon, and Yaaseen introduces us to his fast food based system of economics.  Catchy jingle by Godfrey Johnson. New doses available every Wednesday. Find A is for Awesome on itunes. Follow us on Twitter: @ya_a_seen_him and @karenjeynes.
