A bi-weekly podcast hosted by lipstick enthusiasts KENYA and ZEE, covering pop culture, societal issues and football. With special guest Dope Saint Jude, we discuss the challenges faced by queer women of colour. We also touch on the issue of consent and acceptance across all kinds of sexual preferences deemed as deviant.  Follow us on Twitter: @Zeekny and @Obvszee.
