“A is for Awesome like this podcast” is a weekly podcast from comedian YAASEEN BARNES and writer KAREN JEYNES, where they share interesting facts and stories, and inject a little positivity and entertainment into your day. If you want to know which world record Zimbabwe recently claimed, why babies only blink twice a minute, or why frogs say “ribbit”, this is a podcast for you. Join them on their quest to discover the awesome which is all around us. South Africa has the world’s largest 3D printer, Karen has a talking robot voice in her home, Yaaseen has a cunning plan to poison racists – we’re talking tech innovation, Big Data energy, and saying nice things about our robot overlords, just in case.  Catchy jingle by Godfrey Johnson. New doses available every Wednesday. Find A is for Awesome on itunes. Follow us on Twitter: @ya_a_seen_him and @karenjeynes.
