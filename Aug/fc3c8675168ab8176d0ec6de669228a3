Join The Daily Vox journalists SHAAZIA EBRAHIM and FATIMA MOOSA every week as they chat all things fun and serious around fan culture, fandoms and what it means to be a stan. They’ll be destroying tropes around the supposedly traditional hardcore male football fan and the manic pop culture fangirl; covering everything from football, Young Adult fiction to Beyoncé and K-pop. Living in the fanworld as women of colour who are avid consumers of all things fan-related means that it is impossible to ignore the politics of these things. And that’s what the Critical Stans are all about. Let’s face it. Reality TV is some of the best and worst TV out there. And there’s SO much content. From Keeping Up With The Kardashians to Masterchef, there’s no escaping it. If you don’t watch the show, you will read about it in the media or be bombarded by it on social media. So what’s this obsession with reality TV? Why are we so addicted to it? We talk all of this and more in episode 6 of The Critical Stans with guest Aaisha Dadi Patel.
