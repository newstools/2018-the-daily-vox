Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) students are demanding that the Soshanguve police station be held responsible for the death of third year law student, Katlego Monareng. This was part of a memorandum of demands that they handed over to the police minister Bheki Cele on Wednesday. TUT students took to the streets of Pretoria on Wednesday marching to the headquarters of the police ministry. They handed over a memorandum of demands which was accepted by Cele. Students refused to hand over the memorandum to anyone besides the Police Minister. Along with accountability from the Soshanguve police station, they demanded the department of police start an investigation to check if the conduct of the police delegation which was deployed at the campus was executed in a proper manner. Students also demanded investigations into which officers were sent to the TUT campus and against all the police officers who work at the police stations “We demand police to publicly rectify their statements they made when they said the left the campus with no one injured…” Students say this statement is not true as they say they student was killed by the police officers. The memorandum came from the TUT united structures of the Soshanguve campus. It was on behalf of Pan-African Student Movement of Azania (Pasma), Economic Freedom Fighters Student Command (EFFSC), Democratic Alliance Students Association (Daso), African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) and other student bodies. On Thursday last week, violence erupted at TUT’s Soshanguve campus after allegations of fraudulent Student Representative Council (SRC) elections.
