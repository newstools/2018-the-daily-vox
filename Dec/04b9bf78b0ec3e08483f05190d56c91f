“A is for Awesome like this podcast” is a weekly podcast from comedian YAASEEN BARNES and writer KAREN JEYNES, where they share interesting facts and stories, and inject a little positivity and entertainment into your day. If you want to know which world record Zimbabwe recently claimed, why babies only blink twice a minute, or why frogs say “ribbit”, this is a podcast for you. Join them on their quest to discover the awesome which is all around us. Some awesome things happened in 2018, we promise, in among all the kak. We chat about President Buhari’s imposter syndrome, get all up in our geek feels about Stan Lee, talk about Netflix’s legal battles with the Church of Satan and the Escobars, and put in a shout out to New Zealand’s Prime Minister. https://soundcloud.com/user-754235548/a-is-for-awesome-best-of-2018/ Catchy jingle by Godfrey Johnson.
