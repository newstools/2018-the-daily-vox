Nyanga, the township in Cape Town that has consistently registered the highest number of murders of any precinct in South Africa, finally got a second police station on Tuesday. This followed years of petitions and pleas for the crime-bedeviled community for a second police station to be built in the area. Nyanga, SA’s Murder Capital, Still Only Has 1 Police Station  The minister of police Bheki Cele and the national police commissioner Lieutenant General Khehla Sitole were on site  to launch the new station at Samora Machel in Nyanga, which is situated in temporary buildings until a permanent station is finished in 2023. Some 116 officers and 54 vehicles will be stationed there. Activist Nelisa Ngqulana, who has campaigned for many years for the second station, expressed excitement over the news, saying it has been a long fight. “When you have fought so long for something and you wonder if they couldn’t have done it earlier. It was an almost three-year fight so I’m really excited. There are other people who have been fighting this for a long time. Now the next thing for us is really just to work on the next thing which is to overcome the issue of violence. Now it’s a matter of what we can do next to support the work of the police,” she said. The opening of the station was part of the Western Cape Safer Festive Season Plan. In a statement, the police said the new facility would reduce the case load in Nyanga. “The new facility will alleviate case load from Nyanga police station which is currently the murder capital of the country. Additional personnel and vehicles have been allocated to Samora Machel to serve the community,” the police statement said. According to the 2017/2018 crime statistics, Nyanga station recorded 308 murder cases last year, up from 281 cases in 2016/2017  – the highest in the country once again. On average, 57 people are murdered in South Africa every day. Featured image by the GCIS
