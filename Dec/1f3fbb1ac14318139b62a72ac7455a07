A is for Awesome like this podcast” is a weekly podcast from comedian YAASEEN BARNES and writer KAREN JEYNES, where they share interesting facts and stories, and inject a little positivity and entertainment into your day. If you want to know which world record Zimbabwe recently claimed, why babies only blink twice a minute, or why frogs say “ribbit”, this is a podcast for you. Join them on their quest to discover the awesome which is all around us. We’re back with our podcast Christmas special, asking the vital questions like why is Christmas on the 25th of December, why we have Christmas trees, and how singing Christmas carols might be the most polite form of political protest ever.
