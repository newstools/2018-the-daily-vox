The KwaZulu-Natal Children’s Hospital is in urgent need of revamping; and according to the KZN’s Children’s Hospital Trust, millions are required for the construction of a six-storey building as part of the project. Dr Arthi Ramkissoon of the Children’s Hospital Fund said in a statement that they have already raised some of the amount. Once the project is completed, there will be additional services offered including rehabilitation facilities for children, full occupational physiotherapy gyms, acute rehabilitation wards, and a radiography centre. “Once we have that up and running it will help the rest of the complex to function properly. We want this to be up and running as quickly as possible. If we had the money, we would press the button and be up and running in 18 months time.” “We need about one hundred million to press the button, we’ll need about R 240 million and we’ve raised quite a bit of money…so, if we are able to sell a million bricks we’ll be able to raise the money to start the building and finish it,” he said. The MEC has appealed to good Samaritans to lend a helping hand to fund construction of the facility, in a bid to achieve access to quality healthcare and healthcare services for the children.
