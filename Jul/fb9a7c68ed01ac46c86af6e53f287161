Join The Daily Vox journalists SHAAZIA EBRAHIM and FATIMA MOOSA every week as they chat all things fun and serious around fan culture, fandoms and what it means to be a stan. They’ll be destroying tropes around the supposedly traditional hardcore male football fan and the manic pop culture fangirl; covering everything from football, Young Adult fiction to Beyonce and Kpop. Living in the fanworld as women of colour who are avid consumers of all things fan-related means that it is impossible to ignore the politics of these things. And that’s what the Critical Stans are all about. From Harry Potter to Twilight and The Hunger Games, everybody has heard of young adult fiction. Young adult fiction is a literary category that is becoming increasingly popular with more than half of its readership being over the age of 18. YA, as its known for short, is a category that centers young people and their experiences, thoughts and feelings at the heart of the narrative. But this doesn’t mean it’s only intended for teenagers – far from it. In the second episode of The Critical Stans, we YA, its importance and how YA books and authors deal with the question of representation.
