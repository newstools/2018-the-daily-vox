A is for Awesome like this podcast” is a weekly podcast from comedian YAASEEN BARNES and writer KAREN JEYNES, where they share interesting facts and stories, and inject a little positivity and entertainment into your day. If you want to know which world record Zimbabwe recently claimed, why babies only blink twice a minute, or why frogs say “ribbit”, this is a podcast for you. Join them on their quest to discover the awesome which is all around us. Today we’re talking about an awesome homegrown dinosaur, the Nqwebasaurus Thwazi, and imagining a future where a giant statue of him replaces Cecil John Rhodes in Makhanda, and John Kani voices his roar in Jurassic Park movies. It’s wild.  Catchy jingle by Godfrey Johnson. New doses available every Wednesday. Find A is for Awesome on itunes. Follow us on Twitter: @ya_a_seen_him and @karenjeynes.
