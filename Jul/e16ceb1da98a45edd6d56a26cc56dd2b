A is for Awesome is a weekly podcast from comedian YAASEEN BARNES and writer KAREN JEYNES, where they share interesting facts and stories, and inject a little positivity and entertainment into your day. If you want to know which world record Zimbabwe recently claimed, why babies only blink twice a minute, or why frogs say “ribbit”, this is a podcast for you. Join them on their quest to discover the awesome which is all around us. It’s time to tackle conspiracy theories, from Area 51 and faked moon landings, to the nonexistence of Finland, and our favourite conspiracy theory of all, that Nelson Mandela’s funeral was really an Illuminati cover up. Hold on to your tinfoil hats, it’s going to get weird.  Catchy jingle by Godfrey Johnson. New doses available every Wednesday. You can also catch A is for Awesome on iTunes.
