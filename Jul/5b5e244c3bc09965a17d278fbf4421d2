A is for Awesome is a weekly podcast from comedian YAASEEN BARNES and writer KAREN JEYNES, where they share interesting facts and stories, and inject a little positivity and entertainment into your day. If you want to know which world record Zimbabwe recently claimed, why babies only blink twice a minute, or why frogs say “ribbit”, this is a podcast for you. Join them on their quest to discover the awesome which is all around us. Adele makes us cry, and reminds Yaaseen about the break up he never had – we discuss the science of “emotional arousal”, why certain songs are so damn catchy, and how we can scare people into saving the environment through music.  New doses available every Wednesday. You can also catch A is for Awesome on iTunes. Follow us on Twitter: @ya_a_seen_him and @karenjeynes.
