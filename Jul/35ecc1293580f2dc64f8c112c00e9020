Join The Daily Vox journalists SHAAZIA EBRAHIM and FATIMA MOOSA every week as they chat all things fun and serious around fan culture, fandoms and what it means to be a stan. They’ll be destroying tropes around the supposedly traditional hardcore male football fan and the manic pop culture fangirl; covering everything from football, Young Adult fiction to Beyoncé and Kpop. Living in the fanworld as women of colour who are avid consumers of all things fan-related means that it is impossible to ignore the politics of these things. And that’s what the Critical Stans are all about. We didn’t want to have to say it but… we told you Beyoncé is coming to South Africa. In this podcast we talk how Beyoncé turned us all into Global Citizens. We tackle the Global Citizens platform and how uncomfortable it makes us feel. We speak celebrity ships – like Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin – and why we care anyway. What is it about society that turns us into devout worshippers at the altar of the celebrity? We answer those questions and more in this weeks podcast.  If you missed our last two episodes, check them out below. The Critical Stans Episode One: “World Cup Misogyny”  The Critical Stans Episode Two: “YA Is Lit”  If you have any idea what celebrity culture would look like in the absence of capitalism, tweet us @thedailyvox, @fatimamoosa17 and @shaazzeea. We’d love to hear from you.
