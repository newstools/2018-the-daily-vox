They say that Test matches are won by the team who wins the most sessions. The slow build-up of a Test Victory follows in the spirit of a good, tense chess game. Of course, there are moments when Test Matches are turned on their heads, by an individual act of bravery, madness, or a team effort of note. These are often few, and far between. And for most of the first Test match between South Africa and India, held at Newlands (5-8 January 2017), it certainly wasn’t clear who was in charge. Wickets tumbled, then runs flowed and just as you figured the batsmen were settling, another collapse would emerge. South Africa batted first making 286. India followed, scoring 209. In their second innings, South Africa limped to 130 all out, leaving India to make 208 to win. India was all out for 134, giving the Proteas victory by 78 runs in a low-scoring spectacle. Now that we got that win in the bag, let’s start praying for more rain ko Cape Town — Naledi YaGa Monaledi (@mantse_m) January 8, 2018  Philander doesn’t mess around.
