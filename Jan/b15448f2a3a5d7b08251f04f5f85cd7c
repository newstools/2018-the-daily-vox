If you were born in the late 80s or 90s, chances are you’re part of the Harry Potter generation. We all know the story about the 11-year-old orphaned white boy who gets thrust into the world of witchcraft and wizardry – where, it turns out, he is actually famous. But here’s a plot twist: imagine yourself at Black Hogwarts. If you can’t, that’s okay because Black Twitter did it for you under the epic trending topic that is #BlackHogwarts: a beautiful combination of memes and genius. The Daily Vox rounds up.  Every Harry Potter fan dreamt about receiving the Hogwarts acceptance letter into a school that teaches magic. The first obstacle for black Hogwarts though is every black mother’s objection to witchcraft.  But if a black witch/wizard made it through to Hogwarts, the next obstacle is the sorting hat. Literally a hat with a mouth, it sorts you into a house which becomes your family for the duration of your schooling career. We all know Gryffindor is for the brave, Hufflepuff the compassionate, Ravenclaw the smart-asses and Slytherin for the cunning. But Black Hogwarts has a sorting durag instead. We’re SCREAMING. The most important part of the sorting process is being put in the same house as your fam.  
But if you’re sorted into Slytherin, you don’t have time for peasants. Everyone knows Slytherin didn’t get this far tryna talk to muggles (non-magic folks). 
Can you think of a more fitting Ravenclaw girl squad?  But the best part of Black Hogwarts has got to be the Quidditch matches – the sport that magic folk play on broomsticks. And with Black Hogwarts, every match will begin with Colin Kaepernick-style kneeling. 
Speaking of Quidditch, that Nimbus 2000 Premium Broomstick is not just for flying. Any black mother would see to that. When your mum finally buy you that Nimbus 2000 but tell you to clean your room with it first. #BlackHogwarts pic.twitter.com/LFZbQgpuwH — Danny & Cleo (@DannyAndCleo) January 11, 2018 
Can you just imagine the spectators at the Quidditch games doing the swag surf? A thing of beauty.

And who better to rep opposing houses as legends at Black Hogwarts than Tupac and Biggie? The portraits in Hogwarts be like #BlackHogwarts pic.twitter.com/08qNAC6UY7 — Brianna E. Tyson (@PUSHABRI) January 11, 2018  One thing that was definitely missing from author J.K. Rowling’s Hogwarts is the swag and pizzazz. Let’s be honest, an invisibility cloak? Nobody is rocking a cloak in 2018 (or ever). But invisibility Tims on the other hand, that’s genius and stylish. Invisibility Timbs instead of the Cloak. #BlackHogwarts pic.twitter.com/olkhHMa59N — TJ Sanders (@TubaTeej) January 12, 2018 
Everyone knows sneakers are sacred. If you violate the code of respect and deference for other people’s sneakers, it’s punishable by an Unforgivable Curse.

Imagine the howler you could receive for forgetting your chores. And you thought passive aggressive texts were frightening.

It’s perfect for lurkers – and catching your friends doing what they said they wouldn’t.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good, indeed. #BlackHogwarts me when I peep my best friend on the Maurauder’s Map with that slytherin she swore she was done with pic.twitter.com/5hv1pUptZs — Milto  (@milteaux) January 12, 2018 
But the best part of the #BlackHogwarts trend is the casting. It’s so accurate.
Let’s start with the obvious. There’s only one person that could teach herbology and that’s Snoop Dogg. Professor Snoop, Herbology #BlackHogwarts pic.twitter.com/7RZyxPDMIs — Kiki Roché (@OnionsAndWine) January 11, 2018

As for Dolores Umbridge, she still white.

Say it together now people, Donald Tru-. he whose name must not be spoken #blackhogwarts pic.twitter.com/neHhITeXaP — ismael (@ishhkaz) January 12, 2018  And there would be no confusion in what to call him. There’d be none of this He-who-must-not-be-named, Dark Lord bullshit. His parents named him Tom Marvolo Riddle and he’d be called Tom Marvolo Riddle till the day he died. Conversation about Voldemort at the nearest #BlackHogwarts barbershop.

And the bad guy always gets caught, just ask Jimmy Jacobs. “We asked Gryffindor Jimmy Jacobs if he was worried about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named’s impending return. Here’s what he had to say” #BlackHogwarts pic.twitter.com/Og71k5V1p6 — Jeff J.

Even J.K. Rowling saw it and loved it. @jk_rowling please tell me you are seeing the #BlackHogwarts tweets — IceKareemy (@IceKareemy) January 11, 2018  Seeing them and loving them. #BlackHogwarts https://t.co/UZTVwmh7Uy — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) January 11, 2018 
She might have seen it, she might have been loving it, but let’s not forget we cancelled JK Rowling last year already. I just saw a tweet that said JK was invited to the cookout and…as a Potter head….did y’all learn NOTHING from last year about handing out invites willy nilly? pic.twitter.com/9yQvI18MoU — L.L.
