President Cyril Ramaphosa announced his second cabinet reshuffle on Thursday afternoon, a change enforced by the death of the environmental affairs minister Edna Molewa, and the resignation of the home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba. The Daily Vox gives you the breakdown of which ministers are out, which are new, and which have been shown the door. (This list is a comparison to the cabinet announced after Ramaphosa’s first reshuffle in February 2018.) It wasn’t so much a cabinet reshuffle as a filling in of old posts, in the end. The environmental affairs ministry went to Nomvula Mokonyane, and home affairs to Siyabonga Cwele – both of these ministers vacated the overlapping communications, and telecommunications and postal services departments, which the president has now merged into a single communications and telecommunications, headed by the only new appointee into the cabinet, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, formerly the deputy minister of telecommunications and postal services. In his announcement, Ramaphosa said that the big changes he’s been threatening will come after the national elections next year, presumably when his mandate will be watertight, and his position within the ruling African National Congress party will be far more secure. South Africans need to temper their expectations with regards to unpopular ministers like Bathabile Dlamini, given the balancing act that the president needs to carry out within his party and alliance partners, political analyst Tasneem Essop said in an interview with The Daily Vox. “If he wanted to make big changes before the elections, he would have announced it in February, in his first reshuffle,” she said. 5 Memorable Moments From Malusi Gigaba  Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams – Telecommunications and Communications (promoted from deputy minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services) Siyabonga Cwele – Home Affairs Nomvula Mokonyane – Environmental Affairs David Mabuza – Deputy President Senzeni Zokwana – Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Nathi Mthethwa – Arts and Culture Angie Motshekga – Basic Education Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula – Defence and Military Veterans Edna Molewa – Environmental Affairs Aaron Motsoaledi – Health Michael Masutha – Justice and Correctional Services Mildred Oliphant – Labour Lindiwe Zulu – Small Business Development Rob Davies – Trade and Industry Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma – Presidency: Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation Zweli Mkhize – Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Gwede Mantashe – Mineral Resources Bheki Cele – Police Pravin Gordhan – Public Enterprises Nomaindia Mfeketo – Human Settlements Tito Mboweni – Finance Derek Hanekom – Tourism Blade Nzimande – Transport Jeff Radebe – Energy Naledi Pandor – Higher Education and Training Thulas Nxesi – Public Works Maite Nkoana-Mashabane – Rural Development and Land Reform Lindiwe Sisulu – International Relations and Cooperation Bathabile Dlamini – Presidency: Women Susan Shabangu – Social Development Dipuo Letsatsi-Dube – State Security Ayanda Dlodlo – Public Service and Administration Thokozile Xasa – Sport & Recreation Gugile Nkwinti – Water and Sanitation Nkhensani Kubayi-Ngubane – Science and Technology Edna Molewa Malusi Gigaba
